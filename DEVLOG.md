Got it training! some absolutely bonkers rewards out there, i definitely need to reign in my environment a little
bit by restricting the types of trades its allowed to make:
    1. volume restrictions
    2. price restrictions

I also need to implement reward clipping asap, since some rewards are insane

Apart from that, two things I want to figure out in ray are:
    1. Inference
    2. Custom Model Selection

I need to fix the reward clipping cause i'm getting weird values
